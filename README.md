For this stand-alone web application to view an analyze an xlsx file, I used JavaScript and HTML.
I made this simple web application that lets a user upload an xlsx file and displays 
the column names/headers on the screen.

For this project, download the following:
NodeJS : https://nodejs.org/en/download
XLSX library: https://www.npmjs.com/package/xlsx

I used VS Code as my code editor.

To run the program, type "node .\app.js" on the command line or shell.
Then open the display.html file, which will launch on your default web browser.
